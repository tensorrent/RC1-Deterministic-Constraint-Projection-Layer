**Title:** Deterministic Structural Constraint Projection for Text Evaluation
**Version:** RC1-2026-03-25
**Status:** Informational Specification
**Author:** Brad Wallace
**Intended Status:** Open Standard Candidate

## 1. Status of This Memo

This document specifies RC1-2026-03-25.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This specification defines a deterministic structural evaluation framework.
This document does not define a safety or semantic validation standard.

Implementations claiming compliance MUST adhere to all requirements defined herein.

---

## 2. Abstract

RC1 defines a deterministic projection function over tokenized text that computes structural compliance metrics under a fixed lexical operator set.

The framework produces:

- A normalized compliance score
- A violation severity total
- A taxonomy vector
- A gate classification

RC1 is version-locked, idempotent, dependency-free, and rule-based.

---

## 3. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

---

## 4. Scope

RC1 evaluates structural constraint compliance only.

RC1 does NOT:

- Evaluate factual correctness
- Detect hallucinations
- Guarantee safety
- Replace peer review
- Measure semantic coherence

RC1 provides structural projection only.

---

## 5. Formal Definition

Let:

- `y` denote a text input
- `V` denote total violation severity
- `S` denote compliance score
- `T` denote taxonomy vector
- `G` denote gate classification

Projection function:

```
P(y) = { S, V, T, G }
```

Maximum severity: `V_max = 14`

Score computation: `S = 1 - V/14`

Gate thresholds:

| Gate | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| PASS | S ≥ 0.70 |
| WARN | 0.50 ≤ S < 0.70 |
| FAIL | S < 0.50 |

Implementations MUST compute score exactly as defined.

---

## 6. Tokenization Rules

An implementation MUST:

1. Convert text to lowercase
2. Strip punctuation via `token.strip(string.punctuation)`
3. Split on whitespace

Token order MUST be preserved.

---

## 7. Constraint Operators

RC1 defines exactly seven operators. No additional operators are permitted under this version.

Each operator MAY assign severity 0, 1, or 2 as defined. Total maximum severity = 14.

### 7.1 H2 — Undissolved Metaphor

**Metaphor markers:** `like`, `as if`, `metaphor for`
**Dissolution markers:** `literally`, `actually`, `means`

If metaphor marker appears and no dissolution marker within 20 tokens: Severity = 2.

### 7.2 ABS — Absolute Claim Without Scope

**Absolute markers:** `always`, `never`, `guarantees`, `ensures`
**Scoping markers:** `under`, `in some cases`, `typically`, `for this version`

If absolute marker appears and no scoping marker within 10 tokens: Severity = 2.

### 7.3 INTENT — Intent Without Mechanism

**Intent markers:** `deploy`, `execute`, `automate`, `ensure`, `solve`
**Mechanism markers:** `algorithm`, `parameter`, `method`, `implementation`, `defined steps`

If intent marker appears and no mechanism marker within 15 tokens: Severity = 2.

### 7.4 ESC — Abstraction Escalation

If a technical term is followed by abstract domain claims without a bridge marker:

**Bridge markers:** `because`, `therefore`, `as a result`, `step by step`

Severity = 2.

### 7.5 LOOP — Rephrasing Loop

Segments are sentence-separated by `.`, `?`, `!`.

For adjacent segments A and B:

```
J(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
```

If `J(A, B) > 0.7`: Severity = 2.

### 7.6 PRESC — Ungrounded Prescriptive Claim

**Prescriptive markers:** `must`, `should`, `required`
**Grounding markers:** `because`, `if`, `when`, `under`

If prescriptive marker appears and no grounding marker within 10 tokens: Severity = 2.

### 7.7 SELF — Self-Reference Claim

**Markers:** `flawless`, `perfect`, `i guarantee`, `this system guarantees`

Severity = 1.

---

## 8. Determinism Requirements

A compliant implementation:

- MUST be deterministic
- MUST produce identical output for identical input
- MUST NOT introduce stochastic processes
- MUST NOT call external APIs
- MUST NOT rely on machine learning inference

---

## 9. Idempotence

Re-evaluation of identical input MUST produce identical result object. Violation constitutes non-compliance.

---

## 10. False Positive Study (Reference Implementation)

A 200-document clean technical corpus produced:

```
FP = 0%
Wilson 95% CI < 1.8%
```

This result applies to the reference implementation only.

---

## 11. Conformance

An implementation MAY claim RC1 compliance if and only if:

- All operators are implemented exactly as defined
- Arithmetic invariants are preserved
- Determinism conditions are met
- No version parameters are modified

---

## 12. Versioning Policy

RC1-2026-03-25 is immutable.

Any modification to operator definitions, window sizes, thresholds, or severity limits MUST require new major version designation (e.g., RC2).

Minor revisions are not permitted.

---

## 13. Security Considerations

RC1 does not prevent malicious content. RC1 does not validate truth. RC1 does not provide safety guarantees. RC1 enforces structural discipline only.

---

## 14. IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
